    """Set of Genetic Features of a same DNA sequence, to be plotted together.

    Parameters
    ----------

    sequence_length
      Length of the DNA sequence, in number of nucleotides.

    features
      list of GraphicalFeature objects.

    feature_level_height
      Width in inches of one "level" for feature arrows.

    annotation_height
      Width in inches of one "level" for feature annotations.

    first_index
      Indicates the first index to plot in case the sequence is actually a
      subsequence of a larger one. For instance, if the Graphic record
      represents the segment (400, 420) of a sequence, we will have
      ``first_index=400`` and ``sequence_length=20``.

    plots_indexing
      Indicates which standard to use to show nucleotide indices in the plots.
      If 'biopython', the standard python indexing is used (starting at 0).
      If 'genbank', the indexing follows the Genbank standard (starting at 1).

    labels_spacing
      Number of pixels that will "pad" every labels to force some horizontal
      space between two labels or between a label and the borders of a feature.

    ticks_resolution
      Leave to "auto" for an auto-selected number of ticks on the ruler, or set
      to e.g. 50 for a tick every 50 nucleotide.

    Attributes
    ----------

      default_font_family
        Default font to use for a feature that doesn't declare a font.

      default_ruler_color
        Default ruler color to use when no color is given at plot() time.

      default_box_color
        Default box color for non-inline annotations. If set to None, no
        boxes will be drawn unless the features declare a box_color.
        If "auto", a color (clearer version of the feature's color) will be
        computed, for all features also declaring their box_color as "auto".

      default_elevate_outline_annotations
        Value to use for elevate_outline_annotations when no specific value is
        given at ``graphic_record.plot(...)`` time. Set to true to have all
        text annotations appears above all features, or false else.
